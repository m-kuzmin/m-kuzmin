# HUGO Portfolio site

I wanted to have a place where people can learn about me in more detail. The primary focus at the moment is on the 
hiring process, meaning the site will mostly be populated with info useful to HRs. I anticipate that other sections will
be added later.

## Content structure

- jobs - My employment history. Each has a skill and/or a project tag
- skills - A list of skills I learned somewhere (as tags).
- projects - A list of projects I worked on, usually attached to a job. Each has a skill tag
