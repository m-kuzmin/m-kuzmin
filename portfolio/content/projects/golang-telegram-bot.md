# Overview

An implementation of a simple Telegram bot that echoes back the messages you send to it. Nothing too impressive beyond
parsing JSON and making web requests. This was more of an API integration learning experience than anything.

# Tech stack

- **Golang** and it's std library to control the bot (no frameworks)

# Valuable experience

Learned how to interact with REST APIs, parse JSON and use other Golang std library tools.
