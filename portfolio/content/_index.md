# About me

My name is Max and this my portfolio page. I am a backend developer with work experience from paid employment,
internships, personal projects and formal education. You can view [the projects I did]({{< relref "/projects" >}}) on this site. There's
a [page with my skills]({{< relref "/skills" >}}) that also lists what projects I used that skill in. 

The format of this website allows for more verbosity than the 1-2 pages the resume allows for. I tried to provide some
more details regarding my experience on the project pages.
