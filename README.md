# Hi, I'm Max!

I am a backend developer with work experience from paid employment, internships, personal projects and formal education.
I [have a website](https://m-kuzmin.github.io/m-kuzmin/projects) setup that orginizes the projects I did for employers
and HR people to look at, check it out instead of looking through the repositories aimlessly.

Currently interested in Golang backend development work.
